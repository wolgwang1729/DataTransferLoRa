# DataTransferLoRa
This project aims to send data from various sensors installed in the vehicle to a computer located at some other place a long distance away from the computer continuously and effectively with the help of LoRa.
It requires two SX1278 LoRa Transceivers, Arduino Uno, IR sensor, NEO-6M GPS, DHT-11 sensor, and Ultrasonic Sensor(HCSR04 sensor).

The data it transfers is:
1) Humidity
2) Temperature
3) Distance
4) RPM(Revolutions per minute)
5) GPS data
